Use this notebook to quickly write the methods for the week:

Here's what each rule does:
`rule all`: Specifies the final output files for the entire workflow, including tag directories, peak files in TXT and BED formats, reproducible peaks, filtered peaks, annotated peaks, and motif analysis results.
`rule make_tag_dir`: Runs the makeTagDirectory command from HOMER to generate tag directories for each sample.
`rule findPeaks`: Runs the findPeaks command from HOMER to identify peaks for each sample, using the corresponding input sample as a control.
`rule convertPeakFiles`: Converts the peak files from HOMER's format to BED format using the pos2bed.pl utility.
`rule intersect_peaks`: Uses bedtools intersect to find the intersection of peaks between replicates, creating a set of reproducible peaks.
`rule filter_blacklist`: Filters out the reproducible peaks that overlap with blacklisted regions.
`rule unzip_gtf`: Decompresses the GTF annotation file for use in peak annotation.
`rule annotate_peaks`: Annotates the filtered peaks to their nearest genomic features using the annotatePeaks.pl utility from HOMER.
`rule unzip_genome`: Decompresses the reference genome FASTA file for use in motif finding.
`rule motifs`: Runs the findMotifsGenome.pl utility from HOMER to perform motif enrichment analysis on the filtered peaks.




If asked, you may also include any plots or figures in this notebook as well:
